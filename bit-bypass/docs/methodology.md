# Windows BitLocker Bypass Methodology

## üéØ **Attack Vector Categories**

### **1. Cold Boot Attacks**
**Theory**: Extract encryption keys from RAM after system shutdown
- **Requirements**: Physical access, specialized hardware
- **Success Rate**: Moderate (depends on RAM type and timing)
- **Detection Risk**: Low

**Techniques to Test**:
- Memory freezing with compressed air
- RAM extraction within 1-2 minutes of shutdown
- Bus monitoring for key material
- DMA (Direct Memory Access) attacks

### **2. Hardware-Based Bypass**

#### **A. TPM (Trusted Platform Module) Attacks**
- TPM chip physical access
- Bus sniffing between TPM and CPU
- Timing attacks on TPM operations
- Hardware debugging interfaces

#### **B. BIOS/UEFI Manipulation**
- Boot sequence modification
- Secure Boot bypass
- UEFI variable manipulation
- Hardware debugging modes

#### **C. Drive Controller Access**
- SATA/NVMe controller manipulation
- Firmware modification
- Bad sector remapping exploitation

### **3. Software-Based Approaches**

#### **A. Live Boot Environments**
- Linux live USB with NTFS support
- Specialized forensic distributions
- Memory analysis tools
- Registry offline editing

#### **B. Recovery Partition Exploitation**
- Windows Recovery Environment access
- System Restore manipulation
- Registry backup extraction
- Shadow Copy access

#### **C. Authentication Bypass**
- Sticky Keys exploit (sethc.exe)
- Utilman.exe replacement
- CMD prompt escalation
- Local account manipulation

### **4. Side-Channel Attacks**
- Power analysis during boot
- Electromagnetic emanation monitoring
- Acoustic cryptanalysis
- Timing attack implementations
