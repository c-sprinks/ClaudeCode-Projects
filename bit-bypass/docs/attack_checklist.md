  - [ ] Check TPM bus connections
  - [ ] Document TPM implementation

- [ ] **Test 10**: Bus Monitoring
  - [ ] Monitor TPM-to-CPU communication
  - [ ] Look for unencrypted key exchanges
  - [ ] Timing analysis of TPM operations
  - [ ] Power analysis during boot

#### **E. Storage Device Analysis**
- [ ] **Test 11**: Drive Controller Access
  - [ ] Remove drive from system
  - [ ] Connect to different system
  - [ ] Test direct SATA/NVMe access
  - [ ] Check for controller vulnerabilities

- [ ] **Test 12**: Firmware Analysis**
  - [ ] Extract drive firmware
  - [ ] Look for debugging interfaces
  - [ ] Test firmware modification
  - [ ] Check for backdoors

### **Phase 4: Advanced Techniques**

#### **F. Side-Channel Attacks**
- [ ] **Test 13**: Power Analysis
  - [ ] Monitor power consumption during boot
  - [ ] Look for key-related power patterns
  - [ ] Differential power analysis
  - [ ] Document power signatures

- [ ] **Test 14**: Electromagnetic Analysis**
  - [ ] Monitor EM emissions during boot
  - [ ] Look for cryptographic signatures
  - [ ] Test with software-defined radio
  - [ ] Document frequency patterns

#### **G. Custom Tool Development**
- [ ] **Test 15**: Automated Scripts
  - [ ] Develop custom memory dumpers
  - [ ] Create automated bypass tools
  - [ ] Build evidence collection scripts
  - [ ] Test tool effectiveness
