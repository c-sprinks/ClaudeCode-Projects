# BitLocker Bypass - Current Session Log

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Session Start:** ~15:43
**Current Time:** ~21:00
**Status:** In Progress - Preparing for Forensic Imaging

---

## üéØ **Session Objective**

Create a complete forensic backup of the target laptop's NVMe drive before attempting BitLocker bypass techniques.

---

## üìä **Target System Information**

### **Hardware Identified:**
- **Laptop Model:** Dell (based on DELLSUPPORT partition)
- **Internal Drive:** NVMe - `/dev/nvme0n1` (476.9 GB / 512 GB KIOXIA KBG40ZNS512G)
- **Live USB:** Parrot Security 6.4 on `/dev/sda` (58.6 GB)
- **Evidence Storage:** WD My Passport 4TB on `/dev/sdd1` (3.6 TB usable)

### **Partition Layout:**
```
/dev/nvme0n1 (476.9 GB NVMe)
‚îú‚îÄ nvme0n1p1  150M   EFI System
‚îú‚îÄ nvme0n1p2  128M   Microsoft Reserved
‚îú‚îÄ nvme0n1p3  456.1G BitLocker Encrypted ‚ö†Ô∏è TARGET
‚îú‚îÄ nvme0n1p4  1.2G   Windows Recovery
‚îú‚îÄ nvme0n1p5  17.9G  NTFS (Image partition)
‚îî‚îÄ nvme0n1p6  1.4G   NTFS (DELLSUPPORT)
```

### **BitLocker Confirmation:**
```bash
sudo blkid | grep BitLocker
/dev/nvme0n1p3: TYPE="BitLocker" PARTLABEL="Basic data partition"
```

**‚úÖ Confirmed: Partition nvme0n1p3 is BitLocker encrypted (456.1 GB)**

---

## üîß **Actions Taken This Session**

### **1. System Reconnaissance (15:43 - 16:00)**
- ‚úÖ Booted Parrot Security Live USB
- ‚úÖ Identified all drives and partitions (`lsblk`, `fdisk -l`, `blkid`)
- ‚úÖ Confirmed BitLocker partition: `/dev/nvme0n1p3`
- ‚úÖ Mounted 4TB external drive at `/mnt/backup`

### **2. First Imaging Attempt (15:43 - 20:50) - FAILED**
**Issue:** Extremely slow transfer speed due to USB hub

**Command Used:**
```bash
sudo dc3dd if=/dev/nvme0n1 of=/mnt/backup/nvme0n1_forensic_backup.img \
  hash=md5 hash=sha256 \
  log=/mnt/backup/forensic_image.log \
  progress=on verb=on
```

**Results:**
- Running time: ~5 hours
- Data copied: Only 9.6 GB of 477 GB
- Transfer rate: ~1.92 GB/hour (EXTREMELY SLOW)
- Projected completion: 248+ hours (10+ days)
- **Status:** ABORTED - Too slow

**Root Cause:**
- 4TB external HDD was connected through USB hub on USB-C port
- Live USB was in direct laptop USB port
- USB hubs drastically reduce transfer speeds

**Resolution:**
- Stopped dc3dd process
- Deleted partial image: `nvme0n1_forensic_backup.img` (9.6 GB)
- Deleted incomplete log: `forensic_image.log`
- Cleaned `/mnt/backup/` directory

### **3. Current Status (21:00)**
**Ready to restart imaging with corrected USB configuration**

---

## üîÑ **NEXT STEPS - IMMEDIATE**

### **Step 1: Fix USB Connection (CRITICAL)**

**Current Setup (WRONG):**
- Live USB ‚Üí Direct laptop USB port
- 4TB HDD ‚Üí USB hub ‚Üí USB-C port ‚ùå SLOW

**Correct Setup:**
- Live USB ‚Üí USB hub ‚Üí USB-C port ‚úÖ (doesn't need speed once booted)
- 4TB HDD ‚Üí Direct laptop USB port ‚úÖ (needs maximum speed)

**Commands to Execute:**
```bash
# 1. Unmount external drive
sudo umount /mnt/backup

# 2. Physically swap USB connections:
#    - Move Parrot Live USB to hub
#    - Move 4TB HDD to laptop direct USB port

# 3. Wait 10 seconds for detection

# 4. Verify drive detection
lsblk

# 5. Check USB speed (should see "5000M" for USB 3.0)
dmesg | grep -i "usb.*5000\|usb.*480" | tail -5

# 6. Identify the 4TB drive (might be different device now)
sudo blkid | grep "BitLocker-Eviden"

# 7. Mount to /mnt/backup (adjust device if changed)
sudo mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt/backup

# 8. Verify mount
df -h | grep backup
```

---

### **Step 2: Start Forensic Imaging (Correct Method)**

**EXACT Command to Use:**
```bash
sudo dc3dd if=/dev/nvme0n1 of=/mnt/backup/laptop_backup.img \
  hash=md5 hash=sha256 \
  log=/mnt/backup/imaging.log \
  progress=on verb=on
```

**Expected Results:**
- Transfer speed: 50-150 MB/s (via USB 3.0)
- Total time: 2-3 hours
- Output file: `/mnt/backup/laptop_backup.img` (477 GB)
- Log file: `/mnt/backup/imaging.log` (with MD5 + SHA256 hashes)

**Monitor Progress (in separate terminal):**
```bash
# Watch file size grow
watch -n 10 'ls -lh /mnt/backup/laptop_backup.img'

# Check current size
ls -lh /mnt/backup/laptop_backup.img

# Calculate progress
# (Current GB / 477 GB) √ó 100 = % complete
```

---

### **Step 3: Verify Image After Completion**

```bash
# Check final file size (should be ~477 GB)
ls -lh /mnt/backup/laptop_backup.img

# Review hashes from log
cat /mnt/backup/imaging.log

# Verify mount still works
df -h | grep backup
```

## üìã **After Imaging Completes - BitLocker Analysis**

### **Available Tools:**
- `bit-bypass/tools/bitpixie_exploit.sh` - CVE-2022-34302 exploitation
- `bit-bypass/tools/reconnaissance.sh` - System analysis
- `bit-bypass/docs/bitpixie_research.md` - Attack methodology

### **Analysis Plan:**
1. Mount the forensic image as loop device
2. Run reconnaissance script on BitLocker partition
3. Attempt BitPixie exploit (CVE-2022-34302)
4. Extract Volume Master Key (VMK) from memory
5. Mount BitLocker partition with extracted key
6. Locate target `.txt` file
7. Document all findings for final report

---

## üìù **Important Notes**

### **For Final Report:**
- All commands executed are documented here
- Timestamps recorded for chain of custody
- Failed attempt documented (shows security awareness)
- USB speed issue demonstrates real-world troubleshooting

### **Why Full Disk Image:**
- Complete forensic backup before any manipulation
- Allows restoration to original state if needed
- Captures all partitions (EFI, Recovery, BitLocker, etc.)
- Industry-standard best practice
- Shows professional methodology to professor

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Authorization Reminder**

This is an **authorized educational exercise** for cybersecurity class final project under professor supervision. All activities documented for defensive security learning purposes.

---

## üö® **If Session Disconnects - Resume Here:**

1. **Check if imaging is still running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep dc3dd
   ```

2. **Check current progress:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh /mnt/backup/laptop_backup.img
   ```

3. **If imaging completed, verify:**
   ```bash
   cat /mnt/backup/imaging.log
   ```

4. **If imaging stopped, restart from Step 2 above**

5. **Proceed to BitLocker analysis when image is verified**
