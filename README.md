## 🚀 **Quick Start - Resume Work**

**If resuming after disconnect, check:**
1. Read `CURRENT_SESSION_LOG.md` for current status
2. Check if imaging is running: `ps aux | grep dc3dd`
3. Check progress: `ls -lh /mnt/backup/laptop_backup.img`
4. Follow "NEXT STEPS" in the session log

## 🎯 **Current Phase: Forensic Imaging**

**Target System:**
- Dell laptop with 477 GB NVMe drive
- BitLocker encrypted partition: `/dev/nvme0n1p3` (456.1 GB)
- Using Parrot Security 6.4 Live USB
- Storing image on 4TB WD My Passport

**Next Actions:**
1. Swap USB connections (Live USB to hub, HDD to laptop port)
2. Start forensic imaging with dc3dd
3. Wait 2-3 hours for completion
4. Proceed to BitLocker analysis

## ⚖️ **Ethical Guidelines**
- All activities conducted within authorized educational scope
- Techniques documented for defensive cybersecurity purposes
- No unauthorized access to external systems
- Professional documentation standards maintained
