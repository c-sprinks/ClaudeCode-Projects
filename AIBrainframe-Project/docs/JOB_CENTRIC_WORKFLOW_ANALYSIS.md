# Job-Centric Workflow Analysis & Implementation Plan

## üèóÔ∏è EXISTING ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ Database Foundation - ALREADY COMPLETE
Our database models are **perfectly designed** for job-centric workflows:

#### Core Job Management
- **Job Model** (`jobs` table):
  - job_id, job_number, title, description
  - customer_name, customer_address, customer_phone
  - assigned_user_id, company_id
  - priority, status, job_type
  - scheduled_date, completed_date
  - estimated_hours, actual_hours

#### Equipment Integration
- **Equipment Model** (`equipment` table):
  - Links to jobs via `job_id` foreign key
  - manufacturer, model_number, serial_number
  - installation_date, location_description
  - equipment_type_id for categorization

#### Conversation Context - ALREADY SUPPORTS JOBS!
- **Conversation Model** (`conversations` table):
  - **job_id** foreign key (already implemented!)
  - **equipment_id** foreign key (already implemented!)
  - context_data JSON field for additional context

#### Document Management
- **Document Model** (`documents` table):
  - equipment_type_id linking
  - document_category, file_path, file_type
- **Attachment Model** (`attachments` table):
  - Generic attachment system (attached_to_table, attached_to_id)
  - Can attach files to jobs, equipment, conversations

#### Activity Tracking
- **JobActivity Model** (`job_activities` table):
  - Tracks work done on jobs
  - time_spent, parts_used, notes
  - Links to equipment_id, solution_id

### ‚úÖ API Infrastructure - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
Complete REST API endpoints already exist:

#### Job Management API (`/jobs`)
- `POST /jobs` - Create new job
- `GET /jobs` - List jobs with filtering (status, priority)
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}` - Get specific job details
- `PUT /jobs/{job_id}` - Update job
- `PATCH /jobs/{job_id}/status` - Update job status
- `DELETE /jobs/{job_id}` - Delete job (admin only)

#### Equipment Management API (`/equipment`)
- `POST /equipment` - Create equipment linked to jobs
- `GET /equipment?job_id={id}` - Get equipment for specific job
- Equipment filtering by job_id already implemented

#### Conversation API (`/conversations`)
- **ConversationCreate schema already includes job_id and equipment_id!**
- AI service can access job context through conversation.job_id

## üéØ REQUIRED UI/UX ENHANCEMENTS

### 1. Job Selection Interface
**Current State**: LBOB starts with generic conversation
**Needed**: Job selection before starting conversation

#### Implementation Plan:
```javascript
// Add job selection step to simple_lbob.html
const JobSelector = {
    async loadUserJobs() {
        // GET /jobs to show user's assigned jobs
    },

    async selectJob(jobId) {
        // Create conversation with job_id
        // POST /conversations with { job_id: jobId }
    }
}
```

### 2. Job Context Display
**Show job details in conversation interface:**
- Job number, title, customer info
- Associated equipment list
- Job status and priority
- Previous conversation history for this job

### 3. Document Upload/Attachment System
**Enable file attachments to jobs/conversations:**
- Upload job paperwork, permits, photos
- Link documents to specific equipment
- Access document history during conversations

### 4. LBOB Context Enhancement
**Modify AI service to include job context:**
- Pull job details, equipment info
- Access previous conversations for this job
- Include relevant documents in context

---

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1: Basic Job Selection (High Priority)
1. **Update Web UI**: Add job selection screen before LBOB conversation
2. **Job Context in Conversations**: Show job info in chat interface
3. **Test Job-Specific Conversations**: Verify LBOB gets job context

### Phase 2: Enhanced Context (Medium Priority)
1. **Equipment Integration**: Show equipment details in conversations
2. **Previous Conversation History**: Load past conversations for same job
3. **AI Context Enhancement**: Include job/equipment details in AI prompts

### Phase 3: Document Management (Lower Priority)
1. **File Upload Interface**: Add document upload to jobs
2. **Document Context**: Include relevant documents in AI responses
3. **Photo Analysis**: Enable LBOB to analyze equipment photos

---

## üí° WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

### Current Workflow:
1. Tech logs in ‚Üí Generic LBOB conversation
2. Tech asks question ‚Üí LBOB responds generically
3. No job context or history

### Enhanced Job-Centric Workflow:
1. **Tech logs in** ‚Üí See list of assigned jobs
2. **Select specific job** ‚Üí "Fire Alarm Inspection - Building 123"
3. **LBOB conversation starts** with full context:
   - "I see you're working on the fire alarm inspection at Building 123"
   - "The equipment list shows 2 Siemens panels and 15 smoke detectors"
   - "Looking at previous conversations, the client mentioned intermittent beeping"
4. **Tech asks question** ‚Üí LBOB provides job-specific, contextual response
5. **Conversation saved** to job history for future reference

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### AI Service Enhancement
```python
# Modify ai_service.py to include job context
def generate_ai_response(self, db, conversation, user_message, equipment_id=None):
    context_parts = [self.base_context]

    # Add job context if conversation is linked to job
    if conversation.job_id:
        job = db.query(Job).filter(Job.job_id == conversation.job_id).first()
        if job:
            job_context = f"""
            Current Job Context:
            - Job Number: {job.job_number}
            - Title: {job.title}
            - Customer: {job.customer_name}
            - Status: {job.status}
            - Priority: {job.priority}
            """
            context_parts.append(job_context)

    # Add equipment context
    if equipment_id:
        equipment = db.query(Equipment).filter(Equipment.equipment_id == equipment_id).first()
        if equipment:
            equipment_context = f"""
            Equipment Details:
            - Name: {equipment.equipment_name}
            - Manufacturer: {equipment.manufacturer}
            - Model: {equipment.model_number}
            - Serial: {equipment.serial_number}
            - Location: {equipment.location_description}
            """
            context_parts.append(equipment_context)
```

### Frontend Job Selection
```javascript
// Add to simple_lbob.html
async function initializeJobWorkflow() {
    // Load user's jobs
    const jobs = await fetch('/jobs', {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
    });

    // Show job selection interface
    displayJobSelector(jobs);
}

async function startJobConversation(jobId) {
    // Create conversation with job context
    const conversation = await fetch('/conversations/', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            title: `Job Discussion - ${jobTitle}`,
            job_id: jobId
        })
    });

    // Start LBOB conversation with job context
    initializeLBOBWithJobContext(conversation.conversation_id, jobId);
}
```

## ‚úÖ NEXT STEPS

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Basic job selection UI enhancement
2. **Test Context Integration**: Verify LBOB receives job context properly
3. **Iterate and Enhance**: Add equipment details, document access
4. **Mobile Integration**: Ensure job workflow works in mobile app

The foundation is **100% ready** - we just need to connect the UI to the existing job infrastructure!
